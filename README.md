# Dog Breed Classification Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree

This is my solution to the project **Dog Breed Classification** from Udacity Deep Learning NanoDegree program.

## Language
The code is written in python >= 3.0

## Requirements
packages required: 
numpy
matplotlib
pytorch
torchvision

# How to run

The ipython contains the full code including architecture train and evauation proceudes as they came from Udacity.
In the **model_scratch.pt** and **model_transfer.pt** i provided my pre_trained model to be used.

The model built from scratch reaches 45% accuracy after 100 epochs.
The model using transfer learning with resnet around 90% accuracy after 100 epochs
